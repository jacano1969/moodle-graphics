Moodle SVG icons palette for Inkscape
-------------------------------------

On Linux machines, put the file moodle-svg-icons.gpl into

    ~/.config/inkscape/palettes

directory. On Windows, the directory should be

    C:\Documents and Settings\<your user name>\Application Data\Inkscape\palettes

but I have not tested it.
